## Advanced

portnames = ["PAN", "AMS", "CAS", "NYC", "HEL"]

def permutations(route, ports):
    # Write your recursive code here
    if len(ports) < 1:
        # Print the port names in route when the recursion terminates
        print(' '.join([portnames[i] for i in route]))
    else:
        for i in range(len(ports)):
            permutations(route+[ports[i]], ports[:i]+ports[i+1:])
 
# This will start the recursion with 0 ("PAN") as the first stop
permutations([0], list(range(1, len(portnames))))
